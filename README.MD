forEach - write function which takes array and function as arguments and runs that function per each element in array. Also that function should be invoked with that array element.
Invocation example: 
   forEach( [3, 5, 2], function(el){ console.log(el) } ) // -> 3 5 2


getTransformedArray - write function which takes array and function as arguments and returns new array with every element being transformed by that function.
Note: reuse your forEach function, treat it as just an easy way to write your ordinary ‘for’ iterator, and the function you pass to it as just a body of that iterator.
Invocation example: 
  function increment(num){ return num + 1 } // just returns incremented number
  getTransformedArray( [1, 7, 20], increment ); // -> [ 2, 8, 21 ]


pluckByAttribute - write function which takes array of objects and label of object attribute and returns array of values by that label.
Note: reuse your getTransformedArray function.
Tip: No need to create new array by yourself - getTransformedArray already does that
Invocation example:
  var presidents = [ { name: ‘George’, surname: ‘Kush’ } ,
                               { name: ‘Barako’, surname: ‘Obaame’ } ];
  pluckByAttribute( presidents, ‘name’ ); // -> [‘George’, ‘Barako’]


cypherPhrase - write function which takes object and string and returns string transformed by object rules.
Note: reuse your getTransformedArray function, don’t forget about Array.prototype.join to transfrom array back into string.
Tip: (falsy || ‘truthy’) returns ‘truthy’. e.g. var obj = { }; var letter = obj[‘a’] || ‘a’; // -> ‘a’, because obj[‘a’] would return ‘undefined’ which is falsy.
Tip: you can treat strings as just array of characters.
Invocation example:
  var charactersMap = {a: ‘o’, c: ‘d’, t: ‘g’}
  cypherPhrase( charactersMap, ‘kitty cat’ ); // -> “kiggy dog”


decypherPhrase - write function which takes object and string cyphered with cypherPhrase function and returns string back to normal.
Note: reuse your cypherPhrase function
Tip: easiest way to solve this task is to reverse key-value in charactersMap
Invocation example:
  var charactersMap = {a: ‘o’, c: ‘d’, t: ‘g’}
  decypherPhrase( charactersMap, ‘kiggy dog’ ); // -> “kitty cat”


getTopNRichestNames - write function which takes number that indicates how many names should function return in array and array of objects in a form of 
{ name: ‘Bill Hatso’, income: ‘5B’ } where ‘B’ stands for billion. 
Note: other possible numeric abbreviations : K - thousands, M - millions.
Note: income is NOT going to be of a complex expression such as ‘5B33M135K’, only 1 number and 1 string representing numeric abbreviation.
Note: use Array.prototype.sort, Array.prototype.map and your pluckByAttribute functions.
Tip: for your own convenience you can use 1e9 instead of 1000000000 which pretty much means 10 to the power of 9 in JavaScript.
Invocation example:
  var people = [
    {name: 'Bara', income: '1B'},
          {name: 'Dara', income: '5B'},
          {name: 'Kara', income: '1M'},
          {name: 'Zara', income: '2K'}
  ];
              getTopNRichestNames(2, people); // -> [ 'Dara', 'Bara' ]
      getTopNRichestNames(100, people); // -> [ 'Dara', 'Bara', ‘Kara’, ‘Zara’ ]
